## Environment

1. Create utilities for moving/placing the object at any position
2. Checking if the gripper position is on the object

## Agent

1. Change plotting (figure out how to represent progress in a graphical way)
2. Try soft target update

## Others

1. Set up replay buffer to hold augmented data
   - Rotations can be done later, if we still need performance improvements
2. Random image backgrounds
